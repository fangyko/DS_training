# Age prediction by photo

### Task
Build a model that will determine the approximate age of a person from a photo.

### Tools and skills
Python, Keras

### Output
The trained model has a value of MAE equal to ~6.14.
The photos have a different background, which may affect the quality of the model. In this regard, you can try to select objects by contour. And also in the data there are both b / w and color photos, it would be better to bring the sample to one format.
